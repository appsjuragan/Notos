# Notos

**Notos** is a high-performance, lightweight text editor built with Rust and egui. It combines the minimalist philosophy of classic editors like Notepad with modern, developer-centric features like independent text zooming, smart line numbering, and a plugin-ready architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **⚡ Extreme Binary Size Optimization**: Reached **~1.8MB** (from ~13MB) by removing embedded fonts and trimming heavy dependencies like `anyhow`, `uuid`, and `encoding_rs`.
- **🧩 Dynamic Plugin System**: Robust architecture using an external SDK (`notos_sdk`) to load `.dll`/`.so` plugins at runtime without recompiling the main app.
- **🔗 URL Detection**: Built-in plugin that detects URLs in text. Hold `Ctrl` to underline and highlight URLs, and `Ctrl+Click` to open them in your default browser. Togglable via the Plugins menu.
- **🎨 System Font Loader**: Dynamically loads fonts from the OS (e.g., Segoe UI, Consolas, Segoe UI Symbol/Emoji on Windows). This keeps the binary small while ensuring full UTF-8 icon support.
- **💾 Zero Data Loss**: Automatically saves your session (tabs, content, undo history, and selections) on close and restores it instantly upon reopening.
- **🖱️ Right-Click Context Menu**: Full context menu support for Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All.
- **⚡ Blazing Fast Performance**: Built with Rust for a near-instant startup and smooth editing experience, even with large files.
- **📑 Tabbed Workflow**: Effortlessly manage multiple documents within a single, clean window.
- **🔍 Independent Editor Zoom**: Scale your text (Ctrl + Scroll) without affecting the UI scale.
- **🔢 Smart Line Numbering**: Accurate line tracking that understands word wrapping. Wrapped lines show blank spaces in the gutter, maintaining logical line alignment.
- **🌙 "Bit Grey" Dark Mode**: A custom-tuned dark theme designed to reduce eye strain.
- **↔️ Flexible Word Wrap**: Toggle wrapping on the fly.
- **📊 Comprehensive Status Bar**: Real-time tracking of cursor position (Ln/Col), character count, and line endings (CRLF/LF).
- **↩️ Smart Whole-Word Undo**: Undo/redo operations now correctly group changes by whole words rather than individual characters. The system intelligently detects word boundaries, idling breath-times, and significant block changes while accurately restoring cursor positions.
